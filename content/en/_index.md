Our lab investigates how forest ecosystems change through time. We use mathematical, theoretical, statistical and empirical approaches to address several research questions related to forest dynamics, tree allometry, mortality, and the scaling of tree-level processes to ecosystems. Our research also includes the long-term monitoring of the temperate forests in southern Chile.

Our location is Room 14, Departamento de Gestión Forestal y su Medio Ambiente, in the Universidad de Chile's Antumapu campus in Santiago, Chile. E-mail (see below) is usually the best way to get in touch.
